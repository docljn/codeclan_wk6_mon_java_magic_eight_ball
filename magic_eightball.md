# Homework - Magic EightBall

Model a simple TDD app to simulate a Magic EightBall.

## MVP:
* The EightBall class should take in an ArrayList of answers (maybe 3 to start with).
* The EightBall class should have a method to return a random answer from the list. (Look into the [Collections class](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/util/collections_shuffle.htm) for a helpful method here).

## Extension:
* Add a method that will allow a user to add an answer to the ArrayList of answers.
* Add a method to remove an answer from the ArrayList.
